# dotfiles...a live setup

this is a repo with my dotfiles and other shell utilities live

it currently supports a unified shell experience across
mac and linux systems

boot strapping it is best done using the resources from which all
my work derives

[link to git bare repo dotfile management article](http://bloom.us)

the installer can be used on a new setup like so:

```
# /bin/bash -c "$(curl)"
```

none of the above is true...still need to fix this file :)
